#' Hospital, Doctor, Patient (HDP) dataset.
#'
#' This dataset has a three-level, hierarchical structure with patients
#'   nested within doctors within hospitals. The purpose of this simulation
#'   is not to do a simulation study, but rather to create a rich dataset
#'   that can be used to show a variety of analytic techniques.
#'   However, the principles used in this simulation could be easily
#'   abstracted and a handful or parameters varied to do a simulation study.
